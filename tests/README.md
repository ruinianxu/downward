# Test scripts and data for affordance-based PDDL implementation
This folder contains several test cases for our affordance-based PDDL implementation.

## [Multiple containable 1](https://github.com/ruinianxu/downward/blob/main/tests/scripts/multi_containable_test.py)
This test case for the scenario where multiple objects with containable affordance are seen in the scene but only one object is specified in the goal state.

## [Multiple containable 2](https://github.com/ruinianxu/downward/blob/main/tests/scripts/multi_containable_2_test.py)
This test case for the scenario where multiple objects with containable affordance are seen in the scene and multiple objects are disjunctively specified in the goal state.
